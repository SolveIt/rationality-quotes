<blockquote>
  <p>Today, safe flight inside clouds is possible using gyroscopic instruments that report the airplane’s orientation without being misled by centrifugal
   effects. But the pilot’s spatial intuition is still active, and often contradicts the instruments. Pilots are explicitly, emphatically trained to trust the instruments and ignore intuition—precisely the opposite of the Star
   Wars advice—and those who fail to do so often perish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Gary Drescher "Good and Real"</p>

<p>(I really like this quote as a counterweight to the ubiquitous cliche-advise
to follow you intuition. Often, your intuition may be fooled. And, it cannot
be repeated often enough, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10902" rel="nofollow">Good and
Real</a> is a
must-read for LW-minded folks)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Men ought to know that from nothing else but the brain comes joy, delights,
  laughter, and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and
  lamentations. And by this, in an especial manner, we acquire wisdom and
  knowledge, and see and hear and know what are foul and what are fair, what
  are bad and what are good, what are sweet, and what are unsavory. ... And by
  the same organ we become mad and delirious, and fears and terrors assail
  us. ...  All these things we endure from the brain. ...In these ways I am of
  the opinion that the brain exercises the greatest power in the man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Hippocrates, <em>On the sacred disease</em> (ca. 4th century BCE).</p>

<p>[ In this and other of his writings, Hippocrates shows such an incredible
  early sense for rationality and against superstition that was only rarely
  seen in the next 2000 after that -- and in addition, he was not just a
  armchair philosopher, he actually put these things is practice. So, hats off
  for Hippocrates, even when his medicine was not without faults of
  course...]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their judgment was based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound
  prevision; for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what
  they long for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not
  fancy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- Thucydides, Greek Historian, ca. 5th century BCE (Book IV, 108)</p>

<p>I like Thucydides for the way he tries to explain history in terms of
real-politik, people, their drives and especially without including the gods in
an explanation, somewhat similar to Hippocrates.</p>

<p>Interestingly, a modern version of this appeared in Neal Stephenson's <em>Anathem</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never believe a thing simply because you want it to be true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where it's called <em>Diax's Rake</em>.</p>

<p>Anathem is a great book, I'd like to add, and quite well aligned with many of
the LW themes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"It only stands to reason that where there's sacrifice, there's someone collecting the 
  sacrificial offerings. Where there's service, there is someone being served. The man  who speaks to you of sacrifice is speaking of slaves and masters, and intends to be 
  the master."</p>

<p>~ Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
  -- Carl Sagan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I know this quote is very much a cliche -- but, as a realized a long time after seeing it,  it is not only a nice heuristic, but it also  emphasizes the bayesian, probabilistic view of knowledge over the popperian one.)</p>
