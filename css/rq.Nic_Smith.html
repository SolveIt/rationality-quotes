<blockquote>
  <p>I recall, for example, suggesting to a regular loser at a weekly poker game that he keep a record of his winnings and losses. His response was that he used to do so but had given up because it proved to be unlucky. - Ken Binmore, <em>Rational Decisions</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A side note: All three of the quotes I've posted are from Binmore's <em>Rational Decisions</em>, which I'm about a third of the way through and have found very interesting. It makes a great companion to <em>Less Wrong</em> -- and it's also quite quotable in spots.</p>

<p>"It is therefore highly illogical to speak of 'verifying' (3.8 [the Bernoulli urn equation]) by performing experiments with the urn; that would be like trying to verify a boy's love for his dog by performing experiments on the dog." - E.T. Jaynes, <em>Probability Theory</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since a gene is just a molecule, it can't <em>choose</em> to maximize its fitness, but evolution makes it seem as though it had....  Why, for example, do songbirds sing in the early spring? The proximate cause is long and difficult. This molecule knocked against that molecule. This chemical reaction is catalyzed by that enzyme. But the ultimate cause is that birds are signalling territorial claims to each other in order to avoid unnecessary conflict. They just do what they do. But the net effect of an immensely complicated evolutionary process is that songbirds behave <em>as though</em> they had rationally chosen to maximize their fitness.</p>
  
  <p>Laboratory experiments on pigeons show that they sometimes honor various consistency requirements of rational choice theory better than humans (Kagel, Battalio, and Green 1995). We don't know the proximate explanation. Who knows what goes on inside the mind of a pigeon? Who knows what goes on in the minds of stockbrokers for that matter?  -- Ken Binmore, <em>Rational Decisions</em></p>
