<blockquote>
  <p>"People are mostly sane enough, of course, in the affairs of common life: the getting of food, shelter, and so on. But the moment they attempt any depth or generality of thought, they go mad almost infallibly. The vast majority, of course, adopt the local religious madness, as naturally as they adopt the local dress. But the more powerful minds will, equally infallibly, fall into the worship of some intelligent and dangerous lunatic, such as Plato, or Augustine, or Comte, or Hegel, or Marx." <br /></br>

Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot. They amount to fourteen." <br /></br>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was young, I thought the act of getting older meant, year by year, getting more sophisticated, more hard, cool, and unpitying. Less innocent.</p>
  
  <p>Maybe that was a childish idea of what getting older was about. Maybe adults, mature adults, get more innocent with time, not less. Because the word "innocent" does not mean "naive," it means "not guilty."</p>
  
  <p>Children do small evils to each other, schoolyard fights and insults, not because their hearts are pure, but because their powers are small. Grown-ups have more power. Some of them do great evils with that power. But what about the ones who don't? Aren't they more innocent than children, not less?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moral language persuades best when opinions are not yet formed, which is why writers of children’s literature can get away with saying things like, “Mr. Billings was an awful, horrible man with a heart of stone.”  This sounds like a line from a children’s book because it employs persuasive methods that, though appropriate for children, would insult the intelligence of most adult readers.</p>
  
  <p>Most moral discourse is the conversational equivalent of children’s literature.  Disputants speak to one another—or, rather, at one another—as if their interlocutors failed to pay adequate attention on the day elementary morality was explained.  Unaware of the projective nature of value, they marvel at their opponents’ blindness, their utter failure to see what is so perfectly obvious.  Not knowing what else to do, they scold their opponents as if they were children, and scold them as if they were <em>belligerent</em> children when they fail to respond the first time.</p>
  
  <p>What to do about this?  Take a cue from good writers.  Stick to the facts.  Keep evaluative language to a minimum, and get rid of the most overtly judgmental, moralistic language.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freedom is understood in contrast to its various opposites.  I can be free as opposed to being presently coerced.  I can be free as opposed to being under some other person's general control.  I can be free as opposed to being subject to delusions or insanity.  I can be free as opposed to being ruled by the state in denial of ordinary personal liberties.  I can be free as opposed to being in jail or prison.  I can be free as opposed to living under unusually heavy personal obligations.  I can be free as opposed to being burdened by bias or prejudice.  I can even be free (or free spirited) as opposed to being governed by ordinary social conventions. The question that needs to be asked, and which hardly ever is asked, is whether I can be free as opposed to being causally determined.  Given that some kind of causal determinism is presupposed in the very concept of human action, it would be odd if this were so.  Why does anyone think that it is?</p>

  <p>"Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of "world history," but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened."</p>

  <p>I almost believe we are ghosts, all of us.  It's not just what we inherit from our fathers and mothers that walks again in us - it's all sorts of dead old ideas and dead beliefs and things like that.  They don't exactly live in us, but there they sit all the same and we can't get rid of them.  All I have to do is pick up a newspaper, and I see ghosts lurking between the lines.  I think there are ghosts everywhere you turn in this country - as many as there are grains of sand - and then there we all are, so abysmally afraid of the light.</p>

  <p>I worry far more about the "promising" stock market, particularly the "safe" blue chip stocks, than I do about speculative ventures -- the former present invisible risks, the latter offer no surprises since you know how volatile they are and can limit your downside by investing smaller amounts...  I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans -- when a failure would be of small moment -- and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan.  I am very aggressive when an error in a model can benefit me, and paranoid when an error can hurt.</p>

I've had my moments of looking back with a kind of vertigo realizing how contingent on chance my life has been, how if I'd gotten to the art gallery earlier or later or if the friend I was supposed to have dinner with had showed up, I might not have met my wife that night, and our daughter would still be in an orphanage in Kazakhstan.</p>

  <p>That, I think, is part of the nature of beliefs about justice—they are absolute, bright edged, in a way in which preferences are not.  The point is summed up in the Latin phrase <em>Fiat justicia, ruat coelum</em>—let justice be done though the sky falls.  Those whose bumper stickers read "If you want peace, work for justice" simply take it for granted that there is no question what is just; if you want to find out, just ask them.  The problem with the world as they see it is merely that other people are insufficiently virtuous to act accordingly.</p>

  <p>If you think of losing as “not winning,” then when you try to work out why you’ve lost, or (God forbid) why you’re a loser, you’ll tend to focus on the things you didn’t do and the qualities you don’t have. So it goes with any “negative” concept, one that is defined by what it isn’t (think of how “background” = “everything but the foreground” or how valleys are made by the mountains around them).</p>
  
  <p>I think it’s worthwhile to occasionally invert the picture, to see “being a winner” as “not being a loser.” That way you attend to those habits of mind that are hurting you, instead of the ones that might be helping.</p>
