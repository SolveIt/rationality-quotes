<blockquote>
  <p>I listen to all these complaints about rudeness and intemperateness, and the opinion that I come to is that there is no polite way of asking somebody: have you considered the possibility that your entire life has been devoted to a delusion? But that’s a good question to ask. Of course we should ask that question and of course it’s going to offend people. Tough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only man I know who behaves sensibly is my tailor; he takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-- George Bernard Shaw, writer, Nobel laureate (1856-1950)</p>

<p>Edit: The full citation is to his 1903 play <em>Man and superman: a comedy and a philosophy</em>, where the character John Tanner ("M.I.R.C., Member of the Idle Rich Class") says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, because to be treated as a boy was to be taken on the old footing. I had become a new person ; and those who knew the old person laughed at me. The only 
  man who behaved sensibly was my tailor : he took my measure anew every time he saw me, whilst all the rest went on with their old measurements and expected them to fit me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It helps to stop worrying about what you <em>are</em> and concentrate on what you <em>do</em>. If you think of a poet as a person with some special qualifications that come by nature (or divine favor), you are likely to make one of two mistakes about yourself. If you think you've got what it takes, you may fail to learn what you need to know in order to use whatever qualities you may have. On the other hand, if you think you do not have what it takes, you may give up too easily, thinking it is useless to try. A poet is someone - you, me, anyone - who writes poems. That question out of the way, now we can learn to write poems better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Then the one called Raltariki is really a demon?" asked Tak.</p>
  
  <p>"Yes—and no," said Yama. "If by 'demon' you mean a malefic, supernatural creature, possessed of great powers, life span, and the ability to temporarily assume virtually any shape—then the answer is no. This is the generally accepted definition, but it is untrue in one respect."</p>
  
  <p>"Oh? And what may that be?"</p>
  
  <p>"It is not a supernatural creature."</p>
  
  <p>"But it is all those other things?"</p>
  
  <p>"Yes."</p>
  
  <p>"Then I fail to see what difference it makes whether it be supernatural or not—so long as it is malefic, possesses great powers and life span and has the ability to change its shape at will."</p>
  
  <p>"Ah, but it makes a great deal of difference, you see. It is the difference between the unknown and the unknowable, between science and fantasy—it is a matter of essence. The four points of the compass be logic, knowledge, wisdom and the unknown. Some bow in that final direction. Others advance upon it. To bow before the one is to lose sight of the three. I may submit to the unknown, but never to the unknowable. The man who bows in that final direction is either a saint or a fool. I have no use for either."</p>

  <p>There is an unfortunate optical illusion - a variant on the Doppler effect - that besets all frauds. It's unfortunate, because it has the effect of exacerbating the pecuniary losses that fraud victims endure, by unfairly leaving them, like many rape victims, irrationally ashamed of themselves.</p>
  
  <p>The Doppler principle we posit holds that as a victim approaches a swindler, he sees nothing but green lights. But as soon as he realizes that his money is gone, he spins around and beholds, as if by magic, bright red flags as far as the eye can see.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quotation - yes, but how differently persons quote! I am as much informed of your genius by what you select, as by what you originate. I read the quotation with your eyes,  find a new  fervent sense... For good quoting, then, there must be originality in the quoter - bent, bias, delight in the truth,  only valuing the author in the measure of his agreement with the truth which we see,  which he had the luck to see first. And originality, what is that? It is being; being somebody, being yourself,  reporting accurately what you see  are. If another's words describe your fact, use them as freely as you use the language  the alphabet, whose use does not impair your originality. Neither will another's sentiment or distinction impugn your sufficiency. Yet in proportion to your reality of life  perception, will be your difficulty of finding yourself expressed in others' words or deeds.</p>

<p>I thought about med school again, the anatomy class I had told Jason about.  Candice Boone, my one-time almost-fiancée, had shared that class with me.  She had been stoic during the dissection but not afterward.  A human body, she said, ought to contain love, hate, courage, cowardice, soul, spirit ... not this slimy assortment of blue and red imponderables.  Yes.  And we ought not to be dragged unwilling into a harsh and deadly future.</p>

<p>But the world is what it is and won't be bargained with.  I said as much to Candice.</p>

<p>She told me I was "cold".  But it was still the closest thing to wisdom I had ever been able to muster.</p>

<p>One request I must make of my reader, which is, that in judging these poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely, and not by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others.  How common is it to hear a person say, I myself do not object to this style of composition, or this or that expression, but to such and such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous!  This mode of criticism, so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment, is almost universal: let the reader then abide, independently, by his own feelings, and, if he finds himself affected, let him not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure.

  <p>Billy [Beane] wasn't one to waste a lot of time worrying about whether he was motivated by a desire to succeed or the pursuit of truth. To his way of thinking the question was academic, since the pursuit of truth was, suddenly, the key to success.</p>

<p>A bit of a meta-quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But in choosing a chair we follow the dictates of our eyes, for better or for worse, more often than those of our "ischial tuberosities," and the hammocklike Hardoy <em>looks</em> comfortable. [Joseph] Rykwert correctly assumes that "the buyers of Hardoy chairs, like many other customers for design goods, are guided in their choice by promptings quite different from the dictates of reason." And he adds a conclusion worth remembering: "The very fact that they do so should be a matter of interest to the designer: nothing human should be alien to him."</p>
